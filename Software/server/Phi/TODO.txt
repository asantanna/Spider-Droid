
TO DO LIST
==========

PHI SERVER:

1) Implement JSON calling routines.

2) Add connect button that calls JSON startPhiLink()

3) Change action factory methods to classes ... it's nicer

4) Think about what a reasonable frame rate is.  Think of the speed of joints
   in ADC units and what kind of angle resolution one might expect given
   a particular tolerance, timeout, etc.

5) Joint position tolerance should be a parameter because different values
   are achievable at different speeds.

6) write some sort of MoveAction that takes speed into account.  Should ramp
   up?  Allow specification of max power?

PHI FIRMWARE:

1) HW pumps need to run at a rate adequate to the frame rate. Add new param 
   to JSON start phi link command for server to communicate expected frame rate.
   Use this to set pump delay.

2) Performance web page does not correctly report UART expected loop period.  This is
   because it now runs off of an event.  Change it to report frame period.

3) Figure out some way to make PHI connect again when the link is broken.

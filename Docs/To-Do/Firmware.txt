TO DO LIST FOR FIRMWARE ITEMS
=============================

- Simplify motor naming - too complicated now
    - maybe just do (controller).(index), e.g.  A1, A2, B1, B2 ... F1, F2

- Moving pot a lot causes big drop in frame rate - what's going on? Moving should
  not affect frame rate because polling is constant.
    - Perhaps the jostling causes increased gyroscope traffic?

- Make sure that hardware reads do not block and cause the frame rate to drop

- Make sure the use of metexes is adequate - might be overkill the way it is

- Write support for accelerometer

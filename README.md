Spider-Droid
============

Spider like robot - WORK IN PROGRESS

(THIS IS OBSOLETE - COMPLETE RE-IMPLEMENTATION STARTED)


Sparse Checkout
===============

On Raspberry Pi, it is useful to not have to clone this entire repository
since we only need the firmware.  The other stuff will get pretty big and
take up space needlessly.

To set up for this "sparse checkout", create the directory "Spider-Droid"
somewhere on the RPi and copy the file "do-sparse-checkout" into it. (Use
cut & paste or whatever it takes.)

On RPi, look in file for additional instructions.
